# Multi-threading is the most useful property of Ruby which allows concurrent programming of two or more parts of the program for maximizing the utilization of CPU. 
# Each part of a program is called Thread. So, in other words, 
# threads are lightweight processes within a process



# creating a thread in ruby is very easy.
# there are three blocks (Thread.new, thread.start , thread.fork)
# by which you can create a thread in a program.
# generally thread.new is used to create the thread.
